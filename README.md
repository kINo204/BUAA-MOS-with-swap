# BUAA MOS Operating System, with Challenge Swap

> Not all branches are present, for these are local files while other codes were developed
> on the course's platform.

A mini operating system provided by BUAA-OS and finished as the course's project.

All exercises (except for lab1-extra) have been finished, with the implementation of "supporting memory swapping" in branch "challenge-swap".
> Note the `kern/swap.c` and `kern/sdisk.c` are deprecated, as they've now been merged into `kern/pmap.c` for requirement of the function test.
